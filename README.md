This document describes the functional specifications along with technology guideline for Inniti’s ambitious data analytics project of ‘Widgets & Dashboards. Primary aim of the project is to establish a standard set of data visualization widgets (that are agile, dynamic, responsive and highly interactive in nature) that will be plugged in to a defined set of interactive online dashboards that explain, summarise the underlining business transactional data, primarily but not limited to global insurance domain. These widgets and so the dashboards, are highly customizable, adaptable in nature and are to be built for the web from ground up. 
	Each one of the widget will be produced python tools for data science and visualization. The back-end data ingestion is based on NoSQL systems with connecters to standard and traditional databases such as relational, file based, logs, so on and so forth. The publishing and distribution platform also is based on python stack for web development and delivery. For managing client components and to have richer user experience, appropriate web tools such as Bootstrap, JavaScript will be used as needed. Targeted deployment platform is one distro of Linux Operations system, both bare metal and cloud options included as potential scenarios. Windows operating system will be considered as a last option as that could entail rework and/or refurbishment of some of the constituents of the system.

Primary business domain for the project will be all aspects related to global Insurance, with particular focus on US and European business. Sub domains of interest are Life, Health, PnC, and Mortgage Insurance. The targeted dashboards shall be in the following areas:
 
Primary: [In the current phase]
•	Claims Operations Performance Measures
•	Claims Interactive Historical Drill Down
•	Claims Statistical Measures

•	Sales & Marketing Performance Measures
•	Sales & Marketing Statistical Measures
•	Sales & Marketing Geographic Distribution

Secondary: [In a later phase]
•	Claims Predictive Measures
•	Sales & Marketing Predictive Measure.
•	Explorative Dashboards for Sales & Claims
•	What-If-Analysis dashboards for Sales & Claims
•	Basic Predictive Analytics for Sales & Claims

	Average insurance policy size
	Claims (#)
	Cost per Claim (€)
